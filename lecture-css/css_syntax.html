    <h1>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h1>
    <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
    <p>CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of a specified elements 
        should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts:a selector and a declrartion. </p>
        <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
        <p> Now, the collection of these CSS rules is what's called a style sheet. Now, technically speaking, 
            you don't have to have anything in the style sheet to be called a style sheet. An empty style sheet,
             it technically is a style sheet as well.</p>
