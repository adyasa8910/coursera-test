        Okay. So, here is our internal links page, and we have a couple of links. 
        One it says linking to a file in the same directory, and the one is the DIV. 
        That's the a tag surrounding the div tag that says DIV linking to a file in the same directory. 
        And if we click that, we're going to go to this same-directory.html page which basically just provides a link back to our original page. 
        What's interesting to note here is that the first link, linking to a file in the same directory, is clearly an inline tag since it's not forcing itself to go to a new line. 
        But yet in the second case, div linking to a file in the same directory, we're surrounding the div tag with our a tag. So what's going on here? Are we using block level element, the div, inside an inline element? Well, turns out things are little bit more interesting. 
        Let's take a look at the a tag as defined in the W3C specification. If you take a look closely, the a tag is both a flow content and a phrasing content. In other words, to map it back to the HTML four days, the a tag in the HTML5 is both an inline element and a block level element at the same time.
         And this is what allows us to take the a tag and surround a div tag inside of it.
