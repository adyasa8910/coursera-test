        Roosevelt,who came into office in 1901 and served until 1909, is considered the first modern President 
        because he significantly expanded the influence and power of the executive office. From the Civil War 
        to the turn of the twentieth century, the seat of power in the national government resided in the U.S.
        Congress.Beginning in the 1880s, the executive branch gradually increased its power. Roosevelt seized
        on this trend, believing that the President had the right to use all powers exceptthose that were 
        specifically denied him to accomplish his goals.As a result, the President, rather than Congress or the 
        political parties, became the center of the American political arena. As President, Roosevelt challenged 
        the ideas of limited government and individualism. In their stead,he advocated government regulation to 
        achieve social and economic justice. He used executive orders to accomplish his goals, especially in 
        conservation, and waged an aggressive foreign policy. He was also an extremely popular 
        President and the first to use the media to appeal directly to the people,
        bypassing the political parties and career politicians.&quot;
